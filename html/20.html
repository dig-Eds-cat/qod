        <p>Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and combining King’s College London’s
          Department of History and Centre for Computing in the Humanities with The National
          Archives and Canterbury Christ Church University, The Henry III Fine Rolls Project is a
          unique and pioneering enterprise which democratises the rolls by making them freely
          available in English translation with a sophisticated electronic search engine, the first
          medieval source to be treated in this way.</p>

        <p>The project is making the rolls intelligible, investigatable and freely available in the
          following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An English translation of the rolls in electronic form on the KCL website, with
            indexes and a search facility.</li>
          <li>Printed volumes of the same translation, with full indexes, published by Boydell and
            Brewer.</li>
          <li>Digital facsimile images of the rolls on the KCL website.</li>
          <li>The Fine of the Month feature in which every month comment appears on the website
            about material of interest in the rolls.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Project Team: David Carpenter (KCL), David Crook (TNA), Harold Short (CCH), Louise
          Wilkinson (CCCU), Paul Dryburgh and Beth Hartland (KCL), Paul Spence, Paul Caton, Tamara Lopez and
