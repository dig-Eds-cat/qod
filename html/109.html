<h3>Heinrich Schenker</h3>
<p>Viennese musician and teacher Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935), the twentieth
                    century's leading theorist of tonal music, produced a series of innovative
                    studies and editions between 1903 and 1935, while exerting a powerful and
                    sustained influence, directly and through his pupils, on the teaching of music
                    from the 1930s onward in the USA, and since the 1970s in Europe and
                    elsewhere.</p>
<p>Schenker maintained a vigorous correspondence over nearly half a century, kept
                    a meticulously detailed diary over 40 years, and recorded precise notes on
                    lessons that he gave over a period of twenty years. It is these three
                    collections of personal documents that constitute the core of <em>Schenker
                      Documents Online</em>. </p>
</div>
<div class="unit size1of3">
<h3>Schenker Documents and this Edition</h3>
<p>Schenker left behind approximately 130,000 manuscript and typescript leaves
                    comprising unpublished works, preparatory materials, and personal documents,
                    preserved in two dedicated archives, numerous libraries, and private possession.
                    (See "<a class="int" title="Link to Major Collections" href="/colloquy/major_collections.html">Major Collections</a>.") The archived
                    papers of several other scholars, among them Guido Adler, Oswald Jonas, Moriz
                    Violin, and Arnold Schoenberg, also preserve correspondence and other documents
                    relating to Schenker and his circle.</p>
<p>
<em>Schenker Documents Online</em> offers a scholarly edition of this material
                    based not on facsimiles but on near-diplomatic transcriptions of the original
                    texts, together with English translations, explanatory footnotes, summaries, and
                    contextual material relating the texts to Schenker's personal development and
                    that of his correspondents.</p>

<h3>Latest 2024</h3>
<h4>2024 features Schenker and his Family</h4>
<ul>
<li> Heinrich Schenker had a large extended family, and this is featured in the
                newly available material. It comprised his two brothers; his sister&rsquo;s family
                (the Guttmanns); his wife Jeanette, who was one of ten children (the Schiffs);
                and the family of Jeanette&rsquo;s first husband (the Kornfelds). All of these had
                children and grandchildren. &ndash; Many of them perished in the Holocaust. </li>
<li>
<b>CORRESPONDENCE:</b> Little has been known of these branches of Heinrich&rsquo;s
                family, and yet his diary witnesses how closely he and Jeanette kept to many
                of its members through letters, greetings cards, and mutual visits, and how
                Heinrich took a close interest in their fortunes. In the belief that his
                personality must in part have been conditioned by his family background,
                <em>SDO</em> has devoted 2024 to placing all his correspondence with his
                extended family on the site. &mdash; New to the site also is the correspondence with
                John Petrie Dunn, follower of Heinrich&rsquo;s theory in Edinburgh, and also the
                first of two batches of the correspondence with Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel,
                publisher of several of Heinrich&rsquo;s compositions.</li>
<li>
<b>DIARY:</b> Our edition of Heinrich&rsquo;s diary was completed in 2022. This
                year we present Jeanette&rsquo;s fascinating travel diary of her five-month voyage
                from Europe to South America in 1936, and her stay in Santiago to spread the
                word about her deceased husband&rsquo;s theory.</li>
<li>
<b>PROFILES:</b> The newly supplied profiles include all of Schenker&rsquo;s large
                family, all the people that Jeanette encountered on her South American voyage
                and sojourn, and the many new places and institutions that she visited.</li>
