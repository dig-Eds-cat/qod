			 <P>The <I>Sulpiciae Conquestio</I> survived antiquity in a single
				copy preserved at Bobbio in northwestern Italy and formed part of a collection
				of epigrams and other light verse now known as the <I>Epigrammata
				Bobiensia</I>. Only a few bits of the manuscript now survive (none containing
				this poem, however), and scholars have to rely on four sources that derive from
				transcripts that were made when it was first examined by scholars in 1493 (it
				has been thought that two transcripts were made directly from the Bobbio
				manuscript, but the sheer number of errors suggests instead that only one
				transcript was produced and that our four sources derive from two transcripts
				of that original copy). One of these transcripts was rediscovered by Augusto
				Campana in the Vatican library (Vaticanus latinus 2836), while the other (now
				lost) was the source of the text that was printed in three early editions, all
				of which had independent access to it (Venice 1496; Parma 1499; Venice 1507).
				Reconstructing the lost copy at Bobbio is made the more difficult by the fact
				that the editors of these three editions sometimes incorporated their own
				corrections, but it is clear that the text had survived in extremely bad
				condition, with errors not only in individual words but also in the order of
				lines; and this situation was in no way ameliorated by the fact that the Bobbio
				manuscript was in a very difficult early minuscule script. Modern scholars have
				long been reluctant to accept the attribution to Sulpicia; before the discovery
				of the Vatican manuscript, some even suspected that it was a forgery of the
				Middle Ages or Renaissance. Reference is invariably made to Emil Baehrens'
				Habilitationsschrift of 1873 "De Sulpiciae quae vocatur satira" as the
				definitive demonstration that the poem is a forgery from the age of Ausonius,
				but no one ever seems to cite any of the arguments that Baehrens used. It is
				certainly true that the memory of Sulpicia was still alive in that period (she
				is mentioned by both Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris as well as the
				mythographer Fulgentius), but her reputation was exclusively as a writer of
				sexy poetry about sex within marriage -- which would seem to make her an
				unlikely figure to appropriate for an exercise in denouncing Domitian's
				expulsion of philosophers from Rome. I do not myself know the arguments that
				Baehrens used, but they probably involved a very few metrical anomalies, which
				could well be the result of textual corruption, and a very few close parallels
				in phrasing between this work and later poets like Prudentius and Dracontius,
				which could as easily be explained by their dependence upon her as by this
				author's upon them if they are not entirely coincidental. While not an
				undiscovered masterpiece, the work (as far as we can tell given the wretched
				condition of the text) is competent and effective, and there seems to be no
				sound reason why it should not be taken at face value, as a work written by the
				same Sulpicia, wife of Calenus, who was known to Martial.</P>
