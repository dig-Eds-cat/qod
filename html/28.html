    <p>Welcome to the <cite>Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley (1585-1597)</cite> 
      project at the <a href="http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk">Centre for Editing 
      Lives and Letters</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.ouls.ox.ac.uk/bodley">Bodleian 
      Library</a>. This project is built on open source data, all of which is freely available <a href="https://github.com/livesandletters/bodley1">here</a>.

    <p><a href="biography.html">Thomas Bodley</a> is well known for his bibliographical 
      activities and his benefaction of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, but his 
      prior career as a diplomat has been largely overlooked, despite being celebrated 
      by his contemporaries. A large and comprehensive corpus of letters survives 
      from the twelve years he was on diplomatic business, during initial extraordinary 
      missions as a special envoy to various European sovereigns between 1585-88, 
      and then his long residence in The Hague during his post as English representative 
      on the Council of State for the United Provinces (Netherlands) from 1588-97. 
      These letters, previously unedited and unpublished, are a valuable interdisciplinary 
      resource to scholars of religious, social, cultural, geographical, military 
      and political history. The letters also offer an important understanding 
      of the information networks and patronage structures between official and 
      semi-official diplomatic agents and their patrons in the later sixteenth-century.</p>
    <p>The letters of Thomas Bodley relating to his diplomatic activity between 
      1585-97 will be released in chronological sections. This is Version 6 of 
      the edition. This Version comprises incoming and outgoing letters written  
      in English between Thomas Bodley and his correspondents during the years <a href="http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/cell/Bodley/bodleytimeline.html">1585-97</a>.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">&#x261E;</span> This edition of sixteenth-century 
      letters pioneers a unique transcription method. The letters have been encoded 
      in such a way as to permit readers to custom-build their own transcripts, 
      according to their research preferences. For instance, a general reader 
      may wish to view the letters in their complete, non-abbreviated form, while 
      a scholar interested in orthographic and material features of the period 
      will want to see these reproduced in the transcripts. For more information, 
      see <a href="http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/cell/Bodley/settings.php">settings</a>. Customisable transcripts enable 
      the reader to engage with the text according to their own research needs. 
      Users will be able to mediate the texts to their own specification. Citation 
      of the transcripts takes into account the alternative elements available 
      to view or mask. Furthermore, data generated during the course of the research has been made open and interrogated, thanks to generous funding from the <a href="http://openhumanitiesawards.org/">Open Humanities Award</a>.</p>
    <p>This project is Phase One of two phases. The first phase focuses on the 
      Diplomatic Correspondence and transcribes all letters in English relating 
      to Bodley’s diplomatic experience. The second phase will concentrate on Thomas Bodley’s re-establishment of the Old Library in Oxford, and will gather information concerning donations to the library during the first years of its existence.</p>
